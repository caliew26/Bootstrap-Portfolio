                    Hello, my name is Cali and I'm a leo, I like long walks on the beach and drinking <a href="https://us.coca-cola.com/">Coco-Cola&#8482;</a> (just had to put that, this started off
                    sounding like a dating portfolio, hahahaha). Seriously though, my name is Cali and I was born in
                    Washington State (<a href="https://www.seahawks.com/">go Hawks!</a>) many many many moons ago. I have
                    amazing parents and a few okay siblings. I love to smile and laugh, if thats something someone says
                    about me when I'm not there, I'm very happy with that. I want to spread joy and happyness to everyone I
                    meet and everywhere I go.
                </p>

                <!-- <h4>Family</h4>
                <p>
                    I met my late husband John, 19 years ago on the internet in a chatroom on AOL (Yup, back when that was
                    cool) and in May would be celebrating our 13th anniversary. We had 2 "kids", Trip and Bear. Trip will be
                    15 years old in May and is a jack russell; he loves long naps on his brothers bed and playing tug-o-war
                    with his toy snake. Bear would have been 13 this year, he was a lab/dingo mix; he was a lover, anyone
                    who wanted to pet him was his best friend. We all lived in Kentucky for the past 12 years (I recon I've
                    picked up the "Howdy" and "y'all" from everyone there). Trip and I only recently moved to Florida, I
                    just love the sun! I wanted to be in a "happy place" as I work through some of lifes challenges. I
                    absolutely LOVE <a href="https://www.disney.com">Disney&#8482;</a> and that "family" is such a strong
                    theme with them, it's how I feel too. Have ya ever just went to one of the parks and just sat and
                    watched; so many things to see and enjoy without even moving. Only recently have I been told to bring my
                    lunch and go to Tom Sawyer Park in Magic Kindgom and enjoy a picnic. What a wonderful idea!
                </p> -->

                <h4>Experience</h4>
                <p>
                    I have been in the healthcare industry in some form or fashion since 1995. Most recently I was employed
                    for 10 years with Waystar (formerly known as ZirMed); and the past 4 years was in our engineering team
                    as a QA Analyst. I am a highly-driven, detail-oriented IT professional with a strong background in Operations as well as experienced an agile development environment.  When I moved to Florida I enrolled in the UCF Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp in March 2019.

                <!-- <h4>Faith</h4>
                <p>
                    Christ has a HUGE part in my life. I know that because I put my trust in Him I will enjoy eternal life
                    in heaven; and I'll get to see my hubby again! Looking for an awesome church, come visit <a
