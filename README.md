# Bootstrap-Portfolio

The wonderful opportunity to get to know me; I am a happy-go-lucky kind of person.  You will see a bit about me, my love, my experience (work), my faith and my hobbies.

Also included on the portfolio (link in my navigation) page is the Character Collector, Train Schedule and Trivia Game which are projects that I have worked on and am very proud of.

Please feel free to see my contact page and you'll find a link to my LinkedIn page, my GitHub page and my resume.  Please feel free to email me (email address is listed there too).
